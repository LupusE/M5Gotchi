# M5Gothi

M5Gothi brings the Pwnagotchi functions and interface to the M5Stack platform, providing both automatic and manual Wi-Fi control through an integrated keyboard or button interface, so you can finally go touch some grass and hack at the same time. Inspied by the original Pwnagotchi project. It doesn't have AI, but at least its working like it should.

## Features

- Full Pwnagothi functionality adapted for M5Cardputer
- Manual Wi-Fi control via integrated keyboard UI making it first fully UI-controlled pwnagotchi
- Automatic handshake capture using  Auto Mode
- **Update firmware directly from GitHub, SD card, or built-in Web UI**
- Advanced personality, for better control over pwnagotchi functions
- pwngrid connection for interaction with other pwnagotchis
- GPS support for wardriving or getting location info from pwned networks
- integration with wigle for wardriving data upload
- full file manager with build-in file editor

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> An SD card is **required** for the firmware to function properly on Cardputer. M5StickS3 will use build-in littleFs memory.

### SD Card File Structure

- Configuration file: m5gotchi.conf will be created at first boot and then used to store informations. **Don't mess with it at your own - use device UI to change these values!
- personality will be saved in file called personality.conf.
- Wpa-sec needed files: uploaded.json, cracked.json. Do not edit those files, and if you're running lite mode and need to view them on pc - use text editor of your choice.
- Captured handshakes will be stored inside a folder called:

  ```text
  /M5Gotchi/handshake
  ```

## Usage Instructions

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To use any of the functions, pwnagothi mode must be set to MANU, otherwise nothing will work!

- **UI** is fully controlled via the **built-in keyboard** in cardputer or 2 buttons on M5StickS3
- Use  `G0` button to turn screen off or change the mode - customize this is settings
- Press `ESC` to open the main menu
- Use **arrow keys** to navigate
- Exit apps using `Fn + ESC`
- On first boot there will be created m5gotchi.conf file
- Customize name to your likings via settings
- customize theme to your liking via settings
- Use ENTER to confirm or `y` or `n` when asked to do so
- use `c` to clone wifi when in wifi details menu
- handshakes are stored in `/M5Gotchi/handshake/` folder with filemanes containing SSID and BSSID of network that was pwned

## Update Methods

| Method        | Status    | Description                                     |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| GitHub        | ✅ Done   | Update via GitHub Pages through UI              |

## Core dump reporter (MQTT)

When built with `ENABLE_COREDUMP_LOGGING` the firmware will publish core dump uploads over MQTT to the configured broker. The flow is:

- `device/coredump/meta` - JSON metadata published first. Contains fields:
  - `upload_id` (string)
  - `mac` (string)
  - `board` (numeric board id)
  - `version` (firmware version / build tag)
  - `build_time` (compile timestamp)
  - `reset_reason` (boot reason)
  - `idf` (ESP-IDF version)
  - `chip_model`, `chip_cores`, `chip_rev`
  - `size`, `chunks`, `addr`, `freeHeap`
  - `gps_tx`, `gps_rx` (GPS TX/RX pins configured)
  - `advertise_pwngrid`, `toggle_pwnagothi_with_gpio0`, `cardputer_adv`, `limitFeatures` (boolean flags reported as 0/1)
- `device/coredump/chunk` - messages with a small header JSON (upload_id, seq, len, checksum, total) followed by `\n` and base64-encoded chunk payload.
- `device/coredump/end` - final JSON with `upload_id`, `status`, `sent_chunks`, `checksum` (combined checksum of all bytes).
- `device/coredump/ack/<upload_id>` (or `device/coredump/ack/#`) - the collector should send an acknowledgement JSON with `upload_id`, `status` (`ok` or `complete`), `received_chunks`, and `checksum` when the uploaded file is verified; the device will only erase the core dump after receiving a matching verification ack.
